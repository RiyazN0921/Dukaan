Hello Myself Riyaz Nadaf.
In this project I made using Nodejs,Expressjs,body-parser,mongoose and for database I used mongodb.
Folder Structure:1)Src 2)Controllers:for handling api related code 3)Models:which holds the entities or types of the api
4)routes:which holds the endpoints of the api 5)db.config:to connect database to backend 6)server.js:it is main file of the project

api's made for 1)user 2)chatbot 3)conversation 4)endUsers.
All api's consist of Crud Api like creating,getall,getbyid,update and delete and all api's are done using async and await with try/catch block.
